- Types of SDLC
- Traditional SDLC
- Problems with trad SDLC
- Intro to DevOps
- Benefit of devOps to SDLC
- DevOps Culture
- DevOps Lifecycle
- DevOps Practices
- DevOps Roadmap

SDLC
- Software Dev Lifecycle structural framework that is used to design, build and test the qu
- 

Types
- Waterfall Model
    - ->requirement analysis -> system design-> implementation-> testing-> development-> maintenance
    - Problem with waterfall: rigid, slow, no proper communication between employees

DevOps: Includes practices, strategies and processes that involve the combination of development and operations activities and tasks to foster a more effective and most efficient	application development and delivery process

Benefit Of DevOps: 
- Speed: Innovate quickly to meet the requirements of the market trends
- Collaboration and communication between employees and the devOps engineer
- Rapid Delivery: ability to deliver features, fixes and/or updates to cudtomer
- Scale
- Reliability
- Improved MTTR:

NB: DevOps is a mindset

Grafana New 
 SDLC has 8 Phases
- Operations
    - Deploy:
    - Operate
    - Observe
    - Continious feedback

DevOps Practices
- Continous Integration:Ability to seemlessly integrate new features into your previous project without breaking it
- Continous Delivery: deployment  to the web
- Infrastructure as Code:Using code to implement integration having a source of truth for your implementation
- Microservice Architecture: Breaking down a product into various loosely coupled services
        - Automation: Automating processes through writing processes that automatically execute actions
- Monitoring and Observability: Ability to pinpoint error either in the present to in the future like zero-day
- DevOps Roadmaps 

DAY 2
O.S
Functionality Of O.S
Process Management: program or part of a program that run on a computer that gets loaded to the main memory, to perform task that will need certain computer resources

OS concerning file management

DAY 3
Process
- PCB is a data structure that is maintained for each process in an OS
- Importance of main memory
    - Keep track of used memory space and processes
    - Minimize fragmentation issues
    - Proper utilization of main memory
    - Mention data integrity while executing a process
- Logical Address: Address generated by the CPU during program excecution
- Physical Address: actual address in the main memory where data is stored, it’s the location 
- MMU(Memory management Unit): a physical hardware of a computer that manages its virtual memory and caching function.
- Static Vs Dynamic Loading:Static is Loading the entire program into a fixed address while dynamic loading the entire program and all data of a process must be in physical memory for the process to execute
- In dynamic loading a routine is not loaded until it is called
- Linker is a program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combine them into a single executable file
- Static and Dynamic Linking: 
- SWAPPING: process of swapping a process temporarily into a secondary memory from the main memory which is fast compared to secondary memory (swapping is based on priority)
- Memory allocation:Contiguous Memory Allocation and non-contiguous memory allocation
- Process = executed program
- Fragmentation: when a process is loaded and removed after execution from memory it create a small free hole Types: Internal Fragmentation External Fragmentation
- Paging is the core process under memory managemement

Linux: Is a multi-user OS and has the the that restrict users access based on priviledges
- Etc houses the configuration files in the linux os
- When typing “ls -lr” in a directory you’ll see “rw-r—r—@“ behind this files
Chmod:r=read, w=write
Permissions: u=user, g=group o=others, a=all
- Chmod g+wx xyz.txt
- One can use octal notation to replace the r,w,x like the one listed on the table


DAY 4
LINUX Command - Processes
- Running state: when a state is ready to run
- Sleeping state: when a process is waiting for a resource to be available etc
Commands
- Top: to track running processes on your machine 
- Ps: short for Process Status it display currently running processes
- Kill: stop a running process
VAGRANT
- Used to describe the type of machine required for a project
- Vagrant boxes are the package format for vagrant env, you specify in the vagrant file and it’s used to

DAY 5
sudo service apache2 start #start-apache
sudo service apache2 status #check-start
Comment out
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1" on your vagrant file

- Write a bash script that can run the whole vagrant setup and installations 
- A bash that can install nginx and set it up and use  the bash script as the provisioning overview
- https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/provisioning

PROMOTIONAL TASK
- Create a group: sudo addgroup <groupnam>
- Create a user: adduser <username> -> then you will fill in the command
- Adding an existing user into a group: sudo adduser <username> <groupname>
- Remove existing user from a group without deleting the user or group: deluser <username> <groupname>
- List out groups: compgen -g # get users
- List out users: compgen -u # get users
- List out users that belongs to a group: getent group <groupname>
- Delete group:  delgroup <groupname>
- Delete user: deluser <username>

- How do I change the user/owner associated with file1? # chown user02 file1
- How do I change the group associated with file1?  # chown :groupA file1
- How do I change the owner and group at the same time for file2? # chown user02:groupA file2
- Print user info: id <user>

Relationship is between user > team > company
Celery: queue executing task 

DAY 5
Python For DevOps
- Bash scripting = linux while powershell = windows
- Install python3 
- Set up a virtual env python3 -m venv
- Activate the virtual environment source venv/bin/activate
- Create a py file 
- Import modules (os)
- cwd = Os.getcwd(): gets current working directory
- print(cwd)
