SDLC
- Software Dev Lifecycle structural framework that is used to design, build and test the qu
- 

Types
- Waterfall Model
    - ->requirement analysis -> system design-> implementation-> testing-> development-> maintenance
    - Problem with waterfall: rigid, slow, no proper communication between employees

DevOps: Includes practices, strategies and processes that involve the combination of development and operations activities and tasks to foster a more effective and most efficient	application development and delivery process

Benefit Of DevOps: 
- Speed: Innovate quickly to meet the requirements of the market trends
- Collaboration and communication between employees and the devOps engineer
- Rapid Delivery: ability to deliver features, fixes and/or updates to cudtomer
- Scale
- Reliability
- Improved MTTR:

NB: DevOps is a mindset

Grafana New 
SDLC has 8 Phases
- Operations
    - Deploy:
    - Operate
    - Observe
    - Continious feedback

DevOps Practices
- Continous Integration:Ability to seemlessly integrate new features into your previous project without breaking it
- Continous Delivery: deployment  to the web
- Infrastructure as Code:Using code to implement integration having a source of truth for your implementation
- Microservice Architecture: Breaking down a product into various loosely coupled services
        - Automation: Automating processes through writing processes that automatically execute actions
- Monitoring and Observability: Ability to pinpoint error either in the present to in the future like zero-day
- DevOps Roadmaps 

DAY 2
O.S
Functionality Of O.S
Process Management: program or part of a program that run on a computer that gets loaded to the main memory, to perform task that will need certain computer resources

OS concerning file management

DAY 3
Process
- PCB is a data structure that is maintained for each process in an OS
- Importance of main memory
    - Keep track of used memory space and processes
    - Minimize fragmentation issues
    - Proper utilization of main memory
    - Mention data integrity while executing a process
- Logical Address: Address generated by the CPU during program excecution
- Physical Address: actual address in the main memory where data is stored, it’s the location 
- MMU(Memory management Unit): a physical hardware of a computer that manages its virtual memory and caching function.
- Static Vs Dynamic Loading:Static is Loading the entire program into a fixed address while dynamic loading the entire program and all data of a process must be in physical memory for the process to execute
- In dynamic loading a routine is not loaded until it is called
- Linker is a program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combine them into a single executable file
- Static and Dynamic Linking: 
- SWAPPING: process of swapping a process temporarily into a secondary memory from the main memory which is fast compared to secondary memory (swapping is based on priority)
- Memory allocation:Contiguous Memory Allocation and non-contiguous memory allocation
- Process = executed program
- Fragmentation: when a process is loaded and removed after execution from memory it create a small free holeTypes: Internal Fragmentation External Fragmentation
- Paging is the core process under memory managemement

Linux: Is a multi-user OS and has the the that restrict users access based on priviledges
- Etc houses the configuration files in the linux os
- When typing “ls -lr” in a directory you’ll see “rw-r—r—@“ behind this files
Chmod:r=read, w=write
Permissions: u=user, g=group o=others, a=all
- Chmod g+wx xyz.txt
- One can use octal notation to replace the r,w,x like the one listed on the table


DAY 4
LINUX Command - Processes
- Running state: when a state is ready to run
- Sleeping state: when a process is waiting for a resource to be available etc
Commands
- Top: to track running processes on your machine 
- Ps: short for Process Status it display currently running processes
- Kill: stop a running process
VAGRANT
- Used to describe the type of machine required for a project
- Vagrant boxes are the package format for vagrant env, you specify in the vagrant file and it’s used to

DAY 5
sudo service apache2 start #start-apache
sudo service apache2 status #check-start
Comment out
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1" on your vagrant file

- Write a bash script that can run the whole vagrant setup and installations 
- A bash that can install nginx and set it up and use  the bash script as the provisioning overview
- https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/provisioning

PROMOTIONAL TASK
- Create a group: sudo addgroup <groupnam>
- Create a user: adduser <username> -> then you will fill in the command
- Adding an existing user into a group: sudo adduser <username> <groupname>
- Remove existing user from a group without deleting the user or group: deluser <username> <groupname>
- List out groups: compgen -g # get users
- List out users: compgen -u # get users
- List out users that belongs to a group: getent group <groupname>
- Delete group:  delgroup <groupname>
- Delete user: deluser <username>

- How do I change the user/owner associated with file1? # chown user02 file1
- How do I change the group associated with file1?  # chown :groupA file1
- How do I change the owner and group at the same time for file2? # chown user02:groupA file2
- Print user info: id <user>

Relationship is between user > team > company
Celery: queue executing task 

DAY 5 (Tuesday 4/06/2024)
Python For DevOps
- Bash scripting = linux while powershell = windows
- Install python3 
- Set up a virtual env python3 -m venv
- Activate the virtual environment source venv/bin/activate
- Create a py file 
- Import modules (os)
- cwd = Os.getcwd(): gets current working directory
- print(cwd)

PROMOTIONAL TASK 3
- On a single vagrant file Provision 2 VMS accordingly
    - Web-server
    - database
- configure the web server using a shell provisioner(write the bash script in a different file and reference it using the path option)
- Customize the resources of your vm: memory=1024
- Set up nginx server on your machine
- Configure the db server VM using shell provisioner (write the bash script in a different file and reference it using the path option)
- Customize the resources of your VM memory=2048
- Setup mysql on your machine
- Both machine should be able to communicate with each other on the network

DAY 7 (11/06/2024)GIT
- Version control systems: AKA source code management system software that track and manage changes to files and other digital assets
- Problems VCS solves: 
    - change conflicts, 
    - data inconsistencies,
    - reduced system and code maintainability, 
    - breackdown velocity and speed of development
- Types: local VCS(git), centralised VCS(apache SVN,), distributed VCS(github)

DAY 8 (14/06/2024) BRANCHING STRATEGIES
Gitlab flow
Best practices
Is CI/CD only limited to one flow
- Terminal: ssh-keygen (generate an ssh key in your local machine)
- Your ssh private and public key will be saved in a .ssh folder in the directory you generated your ssh key
- Cat path-to-file/.ssh/ssh-filename-pub: prints out the public keys
- Isometric encryption RESEARCH IT
- Initialise git :git init
- Git remote add

DAY 9 CI/CD(18/6/2)
- Meaning continuous Integration and Continuous Development 
- Why CI/CD:
    - Automation: Reduces manual intervention
    - Efficiency:Speeds up the development Process
    - Quality: Ensure code quality through automated testing
    - Consistency:
    - Feedback
- CI: frequently integrating code changes into a shared repo where automated build and tests are run
- CD: Extension of CI
- Github action: CI/CD tools provided by GitHub that allows you to automate, customise and execute your software development
- Github actions automate processes by setting action as task in a server
- Github action provides servers for you to run your jobs and other workflows
- Actions: reusable unit of code that can be shared across workflows enabling modularity and reuse
- Jobs: A set of steps to be executed as part of the workflow. Each job runs in an isolated environment called a runner
- Runners:are servers that execute your workflows
- .github/workflow/name-of-DIR is where you GitHub is going to be looking for 
- GitHub action uses YAML
- YAML structure: 
    - name: name of the action
    - on: the action is should be monitoring(this is called a trigger workflow)[push,pull-request]
        - Branch: where the action will be watching(optional)
    - Jobs:
        - Runs-on: the OS runner
        - Steps: steps of action you will follow
            - name:
            - uses: action/checkout@v4
            - Name:display Greeting
            - run: | echo “welcome to your GitHub workflow”
        - check-directory”
        - Runs-on:ubuntu-20.04
        - steps:
            - name: List Directories
            - run: ls -a
- Best practices
    - Commit frequent incremental changes:small changes makes it easier to identify issues and ensure smoother integration
    - Write automated Tests: Ensure code quite and catch bugs early
    - Use Secrets: Secure sensitive info like API key and credentials using GitHub secrets
    - Monitor and Optimise:continously monitor CI/CD pipeline for 
    - Fail Fast
- Set up server like nginx with github actions can we access it
